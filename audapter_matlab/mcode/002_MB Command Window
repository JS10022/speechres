PTB-INFO: This is Psychtoolbox-3 for Microsoft Windows, under Matlab 64-Bit (Version 3.0.12 - Build date: May 27 2015).
PTB-INFO: Support status on this operating system release: Windows version 6.1 supported.
PTB-INFO: Type 'PsychtoolboxVersion' for more detailed version information.
PTB-INFO: Most parts of the Psychtoolbox distribution are licensed to you under terms of the MIT License, with
PTB-INFO: some restrictions. See file 'License.txt' in the Psychtoolbox root folder for the exact licensing conditions.

PTB-INFO: Will disable DWM because a regular fullscreen onscreen window is opened -> We want best timing and performance.


PTB-INFO: OpenGL-Renderer is Intel :: Intel(R) HD Graphics 2000 :: 3.1.0 - Build 9.17.10.4229
PTB-INFO: VBL startline = 900 , VBL Endline = -1
PTB-INFO: Beamposition queries unsupported or defective on this system. Using basic timestamping as fallback: Timestamps returned by Screen('Flip') will be less robust and accurate.
PTB-INFO: Measured monitor refresh interval from VBLsync = 0.000000 ms [1.#INF00 Hz]. (0 valid samples taken, stddev=0.000000 ms.)
PTB-INFO: Reported monitor refresh interval from operating system = 16.666667 ms [60.000000 Hz].
PTB-INFO: Small deviations between reported values are normal and no reason to worry.

PTB-WARNING: WINDOWS SYSTEM IS RUNNING IN MULTI-DISPLAY MODE! ALL FLIP STIMULUS ONSET TIMESTAMPS WILL BE LIKELY UNRELIABLE!
PTB-WARNING: STIMULUS ONSET TIMING WILL BE UNRELIABLE AS WELL, AND GRAPHICS PERFORMANCE MAY BE SEVERELY REDUCED!
PTB-WARNING: DO NOT USE MULTI-DISPLAY MODE FOR RUNNING REAL EXPERIMENT SESSIONS WITH ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCURATE TIMING!
PTB-WARNING: ==============================================================================================================
PTB-INFO: All display tests and calibrations disabled. Assuming a refresh interval of 60.000000 Hz. Timing will be inaccurate!
PTB-INFO: Support for fast OffscreenWindows enabled.
